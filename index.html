        <h1>Athena, the playful kitten</h1>
        <img src="images/athena.jpg" alt="Grey cat">
        <p>Athena is a 9 month old kitten from Georgia. Her origins are unknown - she is an enigma. She was residing in a shelter with many other kittens, and the owners did not have space for her anymore. People would come by to look at kittens, but they all passed by her. Luckily, the owner of another shelter located in Connecticut was contacted and asked if they had space for her. She was brought up to Windsor, CT. I went to go look for a new kitten to adopt, and there she was, just arrived the day before! She immediately came up to me and we knew we we’re going to be best pals. A week later, she passed her vet appointment and was ready to come home. Athena is a very happy kitty now, currently in her forever home.</p>

        <p>Athena enjoys the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Long naps</li>
            <li>Eating multiple meals per day</li>
            <li>Playing with her toys</li>
        </ul>
